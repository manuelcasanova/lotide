What would the resulting object look like with the same example string that we used before ("lighthouse in the house")?

Keep in mind that we are supposed to skip spaces.

My answer:
{l: 0, i: 1, 10, g: 2, h: 3, 5, 13, 15 t: 4, 12 o: 6, 16 u: 7, 17, s: 8, 18, e: 9, 14, 19 n: 11 Assuming that the spaces do not count as an index, and the " either

The answer:
{ 
  l: [0],
  i: [1, 11],
  g: [2],
  h: [3, 5, 15, 18],
  t: [4, 14],
  o: [6, 19],
  u: [7, 20],
  s: [8, 21],
  e: [9, 16, 22],
  n: [12]
}

So that means that the spaces do count.Assuming

This is an object that contains keys (property names) that are arrays.
